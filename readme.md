# CExec

CExec is a common execution environment, designed to let users submit WASM applications
(and application sub-components) to remote computers - servers, co-worker PCs,
or a desktop in another room from a cell phone.

The architecture is likely going to be quite volatile for until we reach a `v1.0` status,
so the best place to read about how it works is the Architecture Decision Record directory:
[./adr](./adr).
